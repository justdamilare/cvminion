# Disable Vercel Protection

Your production deployment is currently protected by Vercel Authentication. To make it publicly accessible:

## Option 1: Via Vercel Dashboard (Recommended)
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Navigate to your CVMinion project
3. Go to **Settings** → **General**
4. Find **"Vercel Authentication"** or **"Password Protection"**
5. **Disable** the protection
6. Save changes

## Option 2: Via Project Settings
1. Look for any `password` or `protection` settings in your project
2. Remove or disable authentication requirements

## Current Status
- ✅ **Deployment**: Successfully deployed to production
- ✅ **Environment Variables**: All configured correctly
- ✅ **Build**: Completed successfully with optimizations
- ⚠️ **Access**: Currently protected by Vercel Authentication

## Production URL (Once Protection is Disabled)

## Next Steps After Disabling Protection
1. Test the public accessibility
2. Verify all functionality works in production
3. Set up custom domain (optional)
4. Configure final Stripe webhook endpoints
